# WeReading - Laravel SPA using Vue
```javascript
    // Note from Tony
    //
    // Normally I use Laravel & Nuxt but for simplicity I went this route.
    // Additionally I would normally add some browser tests for better coverage

    // I might clean up the css/styling later at the momment I was building for speed
